This script trains a Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on a dataset of text reviews and their associated sentiment labels (positive or negative). The script performs the following steps:

1. Imports the necessary libraries and modules.
2. Loads the dataset from a CSV file.
3. Cleans the text data using the `clean_text` function.
4. Converts the text data to a numerical representation using TF-IDF vectorization.
5. Splits the data into training and testing sets.
6. Trains the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier on the training data.
7. Evaluates the model's performance on the testing data, printing the accuracy and classification report.
8. Saves the trained model and vectorizer to disk using the `joblib` library.
